## Tomb Raider PS3 Tips and Tricks
  
Tomb Raider is a challenging and rewarding game that requires skill, strategy, and exploration. If you want to get the most out of your adventure, here are some tips and tricks that might help you along the way.

- Use Survival Instincts often. This feature allows you to highlight important objects, enemies, and collectibles in your environment. It can help you find hidden paths, solve puzzles, and plan your attacks.
- Upgrade your weapons and skills. You can find Salvage and XP throughout the game by looting enemies, crates, and animals. You can use Salvage to upgrade your weapons at campsites, and XP to unlock new skills at the Skill menu. Upgrading your weapons and skills will make you more powerful and versatile in combat and exploration.
- Explore every area. The game is full of secrets and optional tombs that contain valuable rewards, such as relics, documents, maps, and treasure. Exploring every area will also help you find more Salvage and XP, as well as challenges that grant bonus XP when completed.
- Use stealth when possible. Sometimes, it is better to avoid direct confrontation with enemies and use stealth instead. You can use your bow to silently kill enemies from a distance, or use cover and distractions to sneak past them. Stealth kills will also grant you more XP than regular kills.
- Use the environment to your advantage. The game features a dynamic and interactive environment that you can use to your benefit. You can shoot explosive barrels, gas cans, or fire extinguishers to cause explosions or fires that can damage or kill enemies. You can also use rope arrows to pull down structures or enemies, or use melee attacks to knock enemies off ledges or into spikes.

These are some of the tips and tricks that can help you survive and thrive in Tomb Raider PS3. If you want more detailed information on each level, collectible, puzzle, and enemy, you can check out this guide by Krystal109[^1^] or this video walkthrough by Kawaii Games[^2^]. Have fun raiding tombs!
