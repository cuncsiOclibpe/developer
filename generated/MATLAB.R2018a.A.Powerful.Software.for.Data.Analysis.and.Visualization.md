## What's New in MATLAB R2018a?
 
MATLAB R2018a introduces several new features and improvements that make MATLAB more efficient and versatile. Some of the highlights are:
 
- **Live Editor:** The Live Editor is an interactive environment where you can write, edit, and run MATLAB code. You can also create rich documents that include live code, output, formatted text, equations, images, and interactive apps. The Live Editor lets you explore your data and results in real time, as well as share your work with others.
- **Data Import and Export:** MATLAB R2018a makes it easier to import and export data from various sources and formats. You can use the Import Tool to interactively import data from files, databases, web services, or hardware devices. You can also use the new writetable function to write tabular data to text files or Excel spreadsheets. Additionally, you can use the new datastore function to create a datastore object that can read large collections of data in chunks.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** MATLAB R2018a offers new and improved functions and tools for data analysis and visualization. You can use the new histogram2 function to create bivariate histograms, or the new wordcloud function to create word clouds from text data. You can also use the new geobubble function to create interactive maps with bubbles that vary in size and color based on your data. Furthermore, you can use the new heatmap function to create heat maps that show how values change across a grid.
- **Performance and Productivity:** MATLAB R2018a improves the performance and productivity of MATLAB by introducing new features and enhancements that speed up your code execution, simplify your workflow, and help you find and fix errors. You can use the new string array data type to store and manipulate text data more efficiently. You can also use the new Code Analyzer messages to detect potential problems in your code, such as unused variables, shadowed functions, or syntax errors.
